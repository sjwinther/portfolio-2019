* [x] Throw some Plex fonts in there
* [x] Go ahead and figure out that vue-router

* [x] Favicon
* [x] Add: Lakseshoppen
* [x] Add: WWLFDMD
* [ ] Add: Initiativet

> Release! And then:

* [ ] Image & video optimization
* [ ] [Add transitions](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html) instead of the clunky fade-ins
* [ ] Kill useless CSS
* [ ] Meta descriptions + tags + twitter + oh god it's too much
* [ ] [Change routing](https://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/history-mode.html) (or prerender?)
* [ ] Make a build script to gh-pages branch
* [ ] 404 handling
* [ ] Add 'next project â†’' btn
* [ ] Add a printable resume-page
* [ ] Have it change colors according to sun up/down (CSS variables could do the trick?)
* [ ] [Vue loop](https://github.com/JosephSmith127/vue-loop)
